# LiteCode testing
This branch is a test branch and test builds will appear here soon.

WARNING: file "litecode-older-python-beta.py" This is only the GNU/Linux version. If you try to compile it for Windows, you will get errors.

# What is the difference between litecode-linux.c and litecode-windows.c?
I had to make two files because the GNU/Linux console uses /bin/sh and Windows uses cmd.exe, but this will be resolved in the future.
